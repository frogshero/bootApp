移动对象必定：
1：暂停应用，能并行的只能是mark阶段
2：对象地址变化，引用对象的对象也要变化？所以先要知道哪些对象引用了被移动的对象

-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold:提升到年老代的阈值。
-XX:G1HeapRegionSize：region大小
-XX:G1ReservePercent：G1会预留一部分内存，制造一个假天花板，防止Evacuation失败

对于需要跨region分配的大对象怎么处理？

Remembered Set或RSet跟踪对象引用到一个给定区域。在堆中每个区域一个RSet。RSet使得区域并行独立的回收成为可能。RSet全部的占用空间影响小于5%。
Collection Set或CSet在一次垃圾回收中将要被回收的区域的集合。在垃圾回收过程中，所有CSet中的存活对象被撤空（拷贝/移动）。区域集合可能是伊甸、
幸存和/或年老代。CSet对于JVM的大小的影响低于1%。
parallel: 多个线程并发
concurrent: 垃圾收集和系统运行同时运行

Remembered Sets or RSets track object references into a given region. There is one RSet per region 
in the heap. The RSet enables the parallel and independent collection of a region. The overall 
footprint impact of RSets is less than 5%.
RSet跟踪对某一个区域的对象引用。RSet允许对一个区域并发和独立收集。
Collection Sets or CSets the set of regions that will be collected in a GC. All live data in a 
CSet is evacuated (copied/moved) during a GC. Sets of regions can be Eden, survivor, and/or old 
generation. CSets have a less than 1% impact on the size of the JVM.
一次GC中要收集的区域。

The heap is partitioned into a set of equally sized heap regions, each a contiguous range of virtual memory.
G1 performs a concurrent global marking phase to determine the liveness of objects throughout the heap. 
After the marking phase completes, G1 knows which regions are mostly empty. It collects these regions first, 
which often yields a large amount of free space. This is why this method of garbage collection is called 
Garbage-First. As the name suggests, G1 concentrates its collection and compaction activity on the areas 
of the heap that are likely to be full of reclaimable objects, that is, garbage. G1 uses a pause prediction 
model to meet a user-defined pause time target and selects the number of regions to collect based on the 
specified pause time target.
G1进行一个"并行"的整堆标记阶段以确定整个堆的对象的活跃度。标记阶段结束后G1知道哪些区域比较空。它先把哪些区域收集。
基于暂停目标，G1选择一定数量的区域进行收集。


G1 copies objects from one or more regions of the heap to a single region on the heap, and in the process 
both compacts and frees up memory. This evacuation is performed in parallel on multiprocessors to decrease 
pause times and increase throughput. Thus, with each garbage collection, G1 continuously works to reduce 
fragmentation. This is beyond the capability of both of the previous methods. CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) 
garbage collection does not do compaction. Parallel compaction performs only whole-heap compaction, which 
results in considerable pause times.
可以降低碎片。CMS不compaction。Parallel只作整堆compaction。内存复制总得暂停应用吧？


The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector (also referred to as the concurrent low pause collector) 
collects the tenured generation. It attempts to minimize the pa uses due to garbage collection by 
doing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads. Normally the 
concurrent low pause collector does not copy or compact the live objects. A garbage collection is 
done without moving the live objects. If fragmentation becomes a problem, allocate a larger heap.
Note: CMS collector on young generation uses the same algorithm as that of the parallel collector.
CMS收集年轻代和Parallel收集器一样。Tenured收集主要是把大多数垃圾收集工作和应用并行。但是CMS不会Compact活的
对象。年老代垃圾收集是不会移动活的对象。有碎片就分配更大的堆。
